# How To Get An OAuth Client ID From Google

Creating an OAuth Client ID for the Google Analytics API is easy and only takes a few minutes.

Just follow the links for these three steps:

## 1. [Enable the Google Analytics API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/analytics.googleapis.com)
  
Click the "Enable" button to enable the Google Analytics API. Move to the next step if it's already enabled.

## 2. [Set up OAuth consent](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) 

If you're just testing things out, this consent info isn't super important yet.

- At a minimum, include the following:
  - Application name
  - Support email
  - **Add this scope: `View your Google Analytics data`**
  - Authorized domains
  - Application Homepage link
  - Application Privacy Policy link
- Then click Save

You can now create a Client ID, but users will see a security warning until your OAuth consent info is verified by Google.

According to Google, development/testing projects or projects which are not yet live to the public are ineligible for verification, so feel free to do that later.

## 3. [Create new "Web application" credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient)
  
Give it a name and be sure to specify the domain origins where you'll be using it from (including `localhost:port` if testing locally). You can always add/remove domain origins later.

### Your Client ID is ready!

You can find it at any time by visiting [API credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). This is also where you'll go to add/remove domain origins from your credentials.

**Your OAuth Client ID should look something like the following:**
