<h1>SessionsByHourChart</h1>

## Description

This [ColumnChart](/ColumnChart) charts the number of sessions for each hour of the day (`0` for midnight, `12` for noon, `18` for 6pm, etc), in the date range specified (number of days ago, until today).

This shows what time of day users are most active and can be helpful for knowing when to post.

Refer to the [Charts Overview](/charts) for a list of all charts available.

## Usage

<Playground>
  <AnalyticsDashboard
    authOptions={{ clientId }}
    renderCharts={(gapi, viewId) => {
      return <SessionsByHourChart gapi={gapi} viewId={viewId} days={28} />;
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| gapi | `GoogleAnalyticsEmbedAPI` | **Required.** The ready and authorized [Google Analytics Embed API](https://devboldly.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/) |
| viewId | `string` | **Required.** View ID for the view the chart pertains to. See [ViewSelector](/ViewSelector) for more information. |
| days | `number` &#124; `undefined` | Optional. Number of days the chart shows data for. Defaults to `28`. |
| container | `string` &#124; `undefined` | Optional. HTML element ID for the container to which the [Google Analytics Embed API](https://devboldly.github.io/react-use-analytics-api/) renders. One will be created if no value is provided. |
| options | [ColumnChartOptions](/ColumnChart#chart-options) | Optional. The options for this chart have been preconfigured, but you can add or override any [ColumnChartOptions](/ColumnChart#chart-options) you'd like here, such as the `width` or `title`. |
| query | [`Query`](/DataChart#query-prop) | Optional. The [query](/DataChart#query-prop) for this chart has been preconfigured, but you can override any [query properties](/DataChart#query-prop) you'd like here. |

This component also supports **all `div` props**, such as `className`, `style`, and `onClick`.

If you have more than one of this chart on the page, be sure to specify a unique `container` ID.

## Data Queried

This query's date range spans from a `start-date` of `NdaysAgo`, where `N` is the `days` prop provided, until an `end-date` of `today`. See [DataChart](/DataChart) for more information on queries.

### Metrics

- `ga:sessions`

### Dimensions

- `ga:hour`

## Customizing

This chart has been preconfigured for ease of use, but you can customize it by providing a `query` or `options` prop.

The properties you specify in either prop object will override the ones used by this chart.

This means you can cherry-pick the properties you'd like to override, such as the `metrics` in the `query`, or the `width` in `options`, without having to create a completely [custom chart](/charts#custom-charts).
